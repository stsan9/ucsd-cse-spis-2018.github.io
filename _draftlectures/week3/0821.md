# Morning:

## 08:45-10am: Paul (Data Mining / Visualization)
  * Junpiter notebook and data analysis intro [notebook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4nPq7yIvSF_NkRYNEVXTnQ3Z3M)
  
  Note: the datascience package is still being setup as of 8/21.
  
  
  Here is a workaround to avoid using jupyter notebook while still run our code
  * Download the python code that we run in class [dataintro.py](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4nPq7yIvSF_Xy14UDhTcW9vdk0/view?usp=sharing)
  
  * Go to the terminal and start ipython by typing the following command. ipython is the same python that we used before except it allows us to show interactive features of python, i.e. plotting.
  
   ipython
  
   %pylab
 
  * You are now in the ipython environment. You will first go to the directory that you have downloaded the dataintro.py by using cd commands
  
  * Then run the dataintro.py script by executing 

   %run dataintro.py
 
  * After the code runs, one last command to show the figures
  
   pylab.show()
  
  You should see the plots displayed properly.
